Bruce Lee’s final film (not counting the ones cobbled together after his untimely death) is arguably the one that "started it all", kicking off the jones for kung-fu that swept mainstream culture in the west in the 1970s. Even Roger Moore’s Bond tried to get in on the craze. Lee plays a Shaolin martial artist working undercover for British Intelligence to bring down the villainous Shih Kien. Culturally it’s fascinating, but purely as a movie experience it still cuts the mustard more than 40 years on. It’s testament to Lee’s sheer power and charisma.
