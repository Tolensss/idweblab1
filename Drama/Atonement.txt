Set during the 1930s in Britain, Briony (Saoirse Ronan) mistakenly believes she’s witnessed her older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), being raped by Robbie (James McAvoy). He’s arrested and later released from prison on the condition he serves in the military during the Battle of France. This award-winning film is about the naivety of childhood, love torn apart by conflict, and how to cope with lifelong regret.
